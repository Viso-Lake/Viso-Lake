# Hi, I'm Farzon (Fara)

I'm a backend engineer working mostly with Go.

I have 7+ years in IT and spend most of my time building backend services, APIs, and infrastructure-aware systems that actually run in production.  
I care about architecture, reliability, and keeping systems maintainable over time.

## What I work with

**Backend**
- Go, Python
- REST, gRPC
- Microservices, API gateways
- PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
- Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS

**Production & Infrastructure**
- Docker, Kubernetes
- CI/CD (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
- Monitoring and logging (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger)
- Linux, NGINX
- Auth and security (JWT, OAuth2)

---

## What I usually do
- Design backend architectures for products and internal systems
- Build and maintain services that run in production
- Integrate with external systems (payments, third-party APIs, internal platforms)
- Set up monitoring, logging, and basic SRE practices
- Debug production issues and improve system reliability
